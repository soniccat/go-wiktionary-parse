|passage=For a Kerr black hole though, one that has spin, the situation is different for the orbits near the black hole. In particular, there are two '''photon spheres''', in contrast with the one photon sphere around a stationary Schwarzschild black hole. The outermost sphere is for photons that are orbiting oppositely to the direction of rotation of the black hole (the ones we say are on ''retrograde'' orbits). Inside this is the '''photon sphere''' for photons travelling in the same sense around the black hole as it is rotating (on ''prograde'' orbits). For a very slowly rotating black hole that isn't so very different from a Schwarzschild black hole, these two '''photon spheres''' are very nearly co-spatial. For black holes of increasing spin, these surfaces are increasingly further apart.}}

====Usage notes====
* The photon sphere is distinct from the [[event horizon]]. An object in ''[[free fall]]'' that crosses the photon sphere from above thence follows an unstable orbit and spirals into the black hole. However—in theory—it can still escape, by receiving a sufficiently large acceleration boost. In contrast, once an object passes through the event horizon it cannot escape, since it would need to be accelerated beyond the [[speed of light]].

===Etymology===
{{root|en|ine-pro|*preyH-}}
From {{inh|en|enm|free}}, {{m|enm|fre}}, {{m|enm|freo}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frēo||free}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*frī}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*frijaz||beloved, not in bondage}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*priHós||dear, beloved}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*preyH-||to love, please}}. Related to {{m|en|friend}}.
{{box-top|cognates, etc}}
Germanic cognates include {{cog|fy|frij||free}}, {{cog|nl|vrij||free}}, {{cog|nds|free||free}}, {{cog|de|frei||free}}, {{cog|da|-}}, {{cog|sv|-}} and {{cog|no|fri||free}}.

Other cognates include {{cog|ru|приятель||friend}} and {{cog|sa|प्रिय|tr=priyá-||beloved}}.

Germanic and Celtic are the only Indo-European language branches in which the PIE word with the meaning of "dear, beloved" acquired the additional meaning of "free" in the sense of "not in bondage". This was an extension of the idea of "characteristic of those who are dear and beloved", in other words friends and tribe members (in contrast to unfree inhabitants from other tribes and prisoners of war, many of which were among the slaves – compare the Latin use of [[liberi]] to mean both "free persons" and "children of a family").<ref>{{R:Etymonline}}</ref><ref>[https://www.dwds.de/wb/frei "frei"] in Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache</ref>
{{box-bottom}}
The verb comes from {{inh|en|enm|freen}}, {{m|enm|freoȝen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frēon}}, {{m|ang|frēoġan||to free; make free}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*frijōn}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*frijōną}}, from {{der|en|ine-pro|*preyH-}}.
